<page><tag>4</tag><title>The Great Write-In Vote Protest That Never Was</title><text>What if, on election day, you wrote in your presidential vote? I'm not trying to persuade you to vote for one or the other, or even for a third party. It's not a trick, My real name isn't George M. Bush, and I'm not going to go to court and claim you were really voting for me. Just write it in. Make a statement that you vote for whom you choose and that it has nothing to do with whichever they feel like printing on the ballot.</text></page>
