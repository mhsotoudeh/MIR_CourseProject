Reed scored a touchdown on a safety blitz, stopped Clinton Portis on a third-and-1 and sprung B.J. Sams for a 78-yard punt return, all in a 2 1/2-minute span in the third quarter. The Ravens scored 14 points without their struggling offense taking the field and that was more than enough to rally from a 10-0 halftime deficit in Sunday night's 17-10 victory over the punchless Washington Redskins.</text></page>
